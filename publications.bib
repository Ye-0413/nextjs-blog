abstract = {In virtual reality, point-and-teleport (P&T) is a locomotion technique that is popular for its user-friendliness, lowering workload and mitigating cybersickness. However, most P&T schemes use instantaneous transitions, which has been known to hinder spatial learning. While replacing instantaneous transitions with animated interpolations can address this issue, they may inadvertently induce cybersickness. To counter these deficiencies, we propose Traceable Teleportation (TTP), an enhanced locomotion technique grounded in a theoretical framework that was designed to improve spatial learning. TTP incorporates two novel features: an Undo-Redo mechanism that facilitates rapid back-and-forth movements, and a Visualized Path that offers additional visual cues. We have conducted a user study via a set of spatial learning tests within a virtual labyrinth to assess the effect of these enhancements on the P&T technique. Our findings indicate that the TTP Undo-Redo design generally facilitates the learning of orientational spatial knowledge without incurring additional cybersickness or diminishing sense of presence.}

  abstract={Edu-metaverse is a specialized metaverse dedicated for interactive education in an immersive environment. Its main purpose is to immerse the learners in a digital environment and conduct learning activities that could mirror reality. Not only does it enable activities that may be difficult to perform in the real world, but it also extends the interaction to personalized and CL. This is a more effective pedagogical approach as it tends to enhance the motivation and engagement of students and it increases their active participation in lessons delivered. To this extend, we propose to realize an interactive virtual teaching assistant called NivTA. To make NivTA easily accessible and engaging by multiple users simultaneously, we also propose to use a CAVE virtual environment (CAVE-VR) as a "metaverse window" into concepts, ideas, topics, and learning activities. The students simply need to step into the CAVE-VR and interact with a life-size teaching assistant that they can engage with naturally, as if they are approaching a real person. Instead of text-based interaction currently developed for large language models (LLM), NivTA is given additional cues regarding the users so it can react more naturally via a specific prompt design. For example, the user can simply point to an educational concept and ask NivTA to explain what it is. To guide NivTA onto the educational concept, the prompt is also designed to feed in an educational KG to provide NivTA with the context of the studentâ€™s question. The NivTA system is an integration of several components that are discussed in this paper. We further describe how the system is designed and implemented, along with potential applications and future work on interactive collaborative edu-metaverse environments dedicated for teaching and learning.},
