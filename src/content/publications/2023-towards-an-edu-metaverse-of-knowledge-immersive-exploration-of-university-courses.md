abstract: "Metaverse, an alternative universe for play, work
and interaction, has become a captivating topic for academia
and industry in recent times. This opens the question on
what a metaverse for education, or edu-metaverse, should look
like. It is believed that this metaverse for learning should be
grounded by a pedagogical theory. Particularly, we propose a
constructivist metaverse learning theory with eight actionable
principles to guide the edu-metaverse and its applications. With
this metaverse learning theory, we further propose the framework
for an edu-metaverse; it is essentially walkable yellow pages that
connect knowledge. The core idea is to combine the structure
of knowledge graphs and the immersion of virtual reality in
order to facilitate association, exploration and engagement in
learning. Our current prototype for this edu-metaverse vision,
K-Cube VR, is also presented. We have tested K-Cube VR for
the introduction of course topics to our students and the results
indicate that our edu-metaverse framework benefits students by
providing a focused environment and structured learning on the
topics of a course, akin to a mind map. Overall, in this paper, we
present an edu-metaverse design that is rooted in a constructivist
pedagogy that already shows promising results from a pilot user
study via our metaverse prototype."
